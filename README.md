# EOSIO Light API

The API is providing information about EOSIO blockchain accounts and
token balances. It is deployed for several blockchains, such as EOS,
Telos, BOS, WAX, and Europechain. Also an endpoint for Jungle testnet is
available.

## HTTP API

In below examples, "eos" stands for the name of the network where API is
taking the data.

* `http://apihost.domain/api/networks` lists all known networks and
  their information.

* Retrieve all token balances, resources and authorization information
 for an account: `http://apihost.domain/api/account/eos/ACCOUNT`

* Retrieve only token balances for an account:
  `http://apihost.domain/api/balances/eos/ACCOUNT`

* Retrieve all account information except token balances:
  `http://apihost.domain/api/accinfo/eos/ACCOUNT`

* Retrieve REX balances (fund, maturing, matured) for an account:
  `http://apihost.domain/api/rexbalance/eos/ACCOUNT`

* Retrieve raw REX information for an account (to perform calculations
  on the client side):
  `http://apihost.domain/api/rexraw/eos/ACCOUNT`

* Retrieve all accounts in all known EOSIO networks dependent on a
 public key (only up to 100 accounts are returned), including accounts
 with recursive permissions: `http://apihost.domain/api/key/KEY`

* `http://apihost.domain/api/tokenbalance/eos/ACCOUNT/CONTRACT/TOKEN`
  returns a plain text with numeric output indicating the token
  balance. Zero is returned if the token is not present or does not
  exist.

* `http://apihost.domain/api/topholders/eos/CONTRACT/TOKEN/NUM` returns
  top NUM holders of a specified token in a JSON array containing arrays
  of (account, amount) pairs. NUM must not be less than 10 or more than
  1000.

* `http://apihost.domain/api/holdercount/eos/CONTRACT/TOKEN` returns the
  total count of token holders as plain text. The result is "0" if the
  token does not exist.

* `http://apihost.domain/api/usercount/eos`
  returns a plain text with total number of accounts in the network.

* `http://apihost.domain/api/topram/eos/NUM` returns top NUM RAM buyers
  in a JSON array containing arrays of (account, bytes) pairs. NUM must
  not be less than 10 or more than 1000.

* `http://apihost.domain/api/topstake/eos/NUM` returns top NUM stake
  holders by sum of CPU and Net stakes, in a JSON array containing
  arrays of (account, cpu_weight, net_weight) tuples. NUM must not be
  less than 10 or more than 1000.

* `http://apihost.domain/api/codehash/SHA256` retrieves all accounts in
  all known EOS networks by contract hash.

* `http://apihost.domain/api/sync/eos` returns a plain text with delay
  in seconds that this server's blockchain database is behind the real
  time, and a status: OK if the delay is within 180 seconds, or
  'OUT_OF_SYNC' otherwise.

* `http://apihost.domain/api/status` returns a plain text with either
  'OK' or 'OUT_OF_SYNC' indicating the overall health of the API
  host. If any of networks experience delay higher than 3 minutes, the
  returned status is 'OUT_OF_SYNC', and HTTP status code is 503.


In addition, adding `?pretty=1` to the URL, you get the resulting JSON
sorted and formatted for human viewing.

## Websocket API

Websocket API is complimentary to HTTP API and is designed for bulk
requests. All communication is compliant with [JSON-RPC version
2.0](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification).

The client is expected to close the websoclet connection after it
finishes using it. The server sends periodic websocket ping requests
and terminates the connection if the client fails to respond.

Bulk methods `get_accounts_from_keys` and `get_balances` require a
parameter `reqid`. The requests return immediately, and the API starts
sending RPC notifications. Each notification has the following fields:

* `method`: the original RPC method that caused the notification;

* `reqid`: the same value as was passed in `reqid` when calling the
  request;

* `data`: row of data according to request. It is omitted when `end`
  is `true`;

* `end`: if present and is `true`, this is the last notification for
  this `reqid`. Additional fields `status` and `error` are delivered
  to indicate the success of operation.

* `status`: only present in the end notification. Value 200 indicates
  success, and 500 indicates an error.

* `error`: only present in the end notification. In case of success,
  this field is set to `null`, and contains an error message
  otherwise.

Notifications are sent asynchronously, and if multiple requests are
being served, the order of interleaving is random. But within each
`reqid` the order of messages is guaranteed to have `end` message as
the last one.

Methods that return token balances deliver the amounts as strings with
exact number of decimals as specified in the token contract.


RPC methods:

* `get_networks` does not require any parameters, and returns a map of
  network name as key and a map of `network, chainid, description,
  systoken, decimals, production` as value.

* `get_accounts_from_keys` requires the following parameters: `reqid`,
  `network`, `keys` (array of public keys to search for, up to 100
  keys). The method generates notifications with `account_name, perm,
  weight, pubkey` in data field. Both legacy and new format of keys
  are supported.

* `get_balances` requires the following parameters: `reqid`,
  `network`, `accounts` (array of account names, up to 100
  accounts). The method generates notifications with `account,
  balances` in the data field, where balances are in an array of maps
  with `contract, currency, amount` keys.

* `get_token_holders` requires the following parameters: `reqid`,
  `network`, `contract` and `currency`. The method generates
  notifications with `account, amount` in the data field, returning
  all token holders and their balances.
